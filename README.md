# Fake-News-Detection
This project involves using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to classify news articles or statements as "True" or "False" (or other categories like "Half-True," "Mostly True," etc., depending on the dataset). The goal is to build a model that can automatically detect fake news based on textual content.
